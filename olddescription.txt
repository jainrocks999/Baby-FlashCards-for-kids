preschoolers and toddlers. The eFlash Cards for Toddlers feature over 450 high-quality
images with text and voiceovers. To enhance visual and auditory learning, there are additional
real sounds where applicable (such as a lion's roar or an ambulance siren).
Parents can turn voiceovers off during parent-child learning sessions and turn them on when the
child is self-learning. They can enable Question Mode to display four images and ask the child
to click on the right answer. The complexity of words is perfect for ages 1 to 4, making it ideal for
siblings to play and learn together.
